This course is designed to introduce graduate students in the cellular, molecular, and neurosciences to basic data analysis and visualization with R. Taught in a seminar style with real-time coding prompts, we will move through the Tidyverse packages, overview statistical analysis, and use some more advanced packages for bioinformatics.

The monthly seminar will be accompanied by office hours where students can share their issues with one another, receive help from the instructors, or ask for help designing and conceptualizing an analysis. The course will run year-round with breaks during the major holidays. Each semester will have a project that students will complete to reinforce the skills and principles they are learning in the course.

Skills in data science are highly sought after in academia and beyond as computational analyses become the norm in basic science. This course is designed to be a continuous resource throughout a student's time in their respective program. With the introduction of novel analysis techniques, community resources, and an accessible introduction into data science, students will have a stronger computational skill set to tackle their future scientific and career goals.
